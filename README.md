Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

My code will be found in the WeatherPy Folder, both files with code are WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb as well as the figures and CSVs that were offloaded from the data. 

This challenge was most difficult for me, I ran into a couple of bugs along the way but I was able to debug.

I found that temperature does indeed get hotter as you get to the equator, but over all windspeed and humidity does not really change. Windspeed depends more on location, I am sure we can find a correlation between windspeed and altitude but altitude data is not in this set. Same can be said with humidity, I am sure there is a correlation between proximity to bodies of water but we were not testing for that. Purely on location data. 

Ideally Albany, NY USA would be a good place to vacation weather wise, but there is no hotel with accomedations there. Next best city to vaction would be Ayacucho, Peru. It has the Hotel Las Americas, which does have accomedations. Ayacucho would be my choice between the two since the weather there is cooler, the humidity is lower than 50% and the windspeed is not too bad either.
